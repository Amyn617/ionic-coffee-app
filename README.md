## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android builds)
- Unsplash API key (already set in `.env`)

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Run the app in development mode:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

3. **Run unit tests:**

   ```bash
   npm run test.unit
   # or
   yarn test.unit
   ```

4. **Run end-to-end (E2E) tests:**

   ```bash
   npm run test.e2e
   # or
   yarn test.e2e
   ```

5. **Build for production:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

6. **Preview the production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   # or
   yarn preview
   ```

## Android Build (Capacitor)

1. **Build the web app:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Sync with Capacitor:**

   ```bash
   npx cap sync android
   ```

3. **Open Android Studio:**

   ```bash
   npx cap open android
   ```

4. **Build and run the app on an emulator or device from Android Studio.**

## Environment Variables

- The Unsplash API key is stored in `.env` as `VITE_UNSPLASH_API_KEY`.

## Linting

To check code style and lint errors:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

## Notes

- The `android/` directory contains the native Android project. Do **not** ignore it in version control, but build outputs and local configs are already gitignored.
- For iOS builds, you can add the iOS platform with Capacitor (`npx cap add ios`) and use Xcode.
